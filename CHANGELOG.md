# Change Log

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/). Loosely because we do not keep separate sections within a version for additions and fixes etcetera, instead most logged changes will start with one of Added, Changed, Updated, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, or Security. This project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
